       "['The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve released final 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test results for Bank of America. Based on the results, our stress capital buffer (SCB) will be 2.5 percent, 90 basis points (bps) lower than the current level of 3.4 percent, and our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) minimum requirement will decline to 9.5 percent effective October 1, 2023. Beginning January 1, 2024, we expect our minimum CET1 requirement to increase 50 bps, aligned with planned growth in the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge.',\n",
       " 'On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would update future U.S. regulatory capital requirements, including the calculation of risk-weighted assets and the G-SIB surcharge. Under the capital proposal, the requirements would be phased in over three years beginning July 1, 2025. The Corporation is evaluating the impact of the proposed rules on its regulatory capital.',\n",
